## Development Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version >=18.16
- yarn version >=1.22


## Installation

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine

   After forking, run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com/your-username/acreom.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies

   Navigate to the project directories (quick capture, frontend, and electron) and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd acreom
    cd frontend
    yarn install
    cd ..
    cd electron
    yarn install
    cd ..
    cd quick-capture
    yarn install 
    ```

### Steps

Start Quick Capture, frontend, then run electron

The order in which you run the commands is important. Electron binds to the port that is used by the frontend, so you need to start the frontend first. Quick Capture doesn't need to be started at all, you can skip the step entirely.

 ```bash
cd frontend
yarn dev
 ```
```bash
cd electron
yarn dev
```
```bash
cd quick-capture
yarn dev
 ```
